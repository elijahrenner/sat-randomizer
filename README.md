# description
Started in curiousity of the probability that randomly guessing multiple-choice questions on the SAT yields a perfect score. The probability, proven by the code and equal to 1/4^98, approaches zero:

(9.9568244e-60% or 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000099568244%)

## Distributions

These distributions show the frequency of scores over 10,000,000 iterations using different guessing strategies.

# usage & details

The code assumes 4 modules: two reading, two math. Modules are not adaptive like the real Digital SAT, so results may not properly simulate an actual testing environment. This discrepancy does not affect results since predictions are random.

You may use this code however you please.
