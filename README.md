# description
Started in curiousity of the probability that randomly guessing multiple-choice questions on the SAT would eventually yield a perfect score. The probability, as this code proves, practically approaches zero:

(9.9568244e-60% or 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000099568244%)

# usage & details

The code assumes 4 modules: two reading, two math. Modules are not adaptive like the real Digital SAT, so results may not properly simulate an actual testing environment. This discrepancy does not affect results since predictions are random.

You may use this code however you please.
